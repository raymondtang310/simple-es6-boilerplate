# Simple ES6 Boilerplate

This is a simple Node.js project that serves as a boilerplate including [ES6](http://es6-features.org).

Also included is the use of [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), a tool which automatically restarts the server upon detecting changes in the source code.

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Run application
```bash
# run in development mode (uses babel-node to execute ES6 code)
npm run dev

# run in production mode (transpiles ES6 source code into ES5 code and executes the ES5 code)
npm start
```
